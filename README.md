## Kaggle_Courses

Kaggle is the most popular platform for Data Science. It has multiple free datasets,
projects that you can use for practice, and competitions that have insane prizes! 
It also has a helpful community where you can share your thoughts and learn new things.
But the best feature of Kaggle is **Kaggle Learn**. Even if you donâ€™t know anything about data science,
you can learn all the basics from Kaggle Courses and then move on to sharpening your skills by doing projects.

In this repository, the Kaggle learn course tutorial and excerses nootbooks(.ipynb) are available
which I have done and earned completion certificates. The dataset used in perticular course are avalable
